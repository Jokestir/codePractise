AsyncTask
---------


+ Used for heavy tasks. The results of these tasks can be passed to UI.


Advantages
-----------

+ Need to create threads, handlers etc.

+ Use only for task which requires 3-8 seconds

+ Dont use for network requests, imageLoading.  


How to use it
--------------

1. Inherit AsyncTask class and override these methods: doInBackground, onPreExecute, onPostExecute. 


		+ doInBackground - new thread. Contains heavy taks. Does not have access to UI.
			
		+ onPreExecute   - perfomed before doInbackground. has access to MainUI

		+ onPostExecute  - performed after doInbackground. has access to UI.

2. 



Misc
----

+ dont directly call onbackgroud,onpreexecute,onpostexecute

+ Async object should be created in UI thread

+ There should be only one asynctask.execute statement

+ execute method should be invoked in teh UI thread
